    <h1>Kelly Keating</h1>
    <p>I am a recent graduate of Enspiral Dev Academy, Javascript coder, maker of websites, and creator of games such as The Gitmaster and PurrPolice.</p>
    <p>My love of code and creating interactions came from an enthusiasm for puzzles. I love trying to work my way around a problem, finding simple solutions in complex systems, and being able to produce something awesome at the end of it.</p>
